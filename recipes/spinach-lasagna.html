		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>cooking spray</li>
			<li><strong>9</strong> lasagna noodles</li>
			<li><strong>1 bunch</strong> fresh spinach</li>
			<li><strong>1 container</strong> ricotta cheese</li>
			<li><strong>½ cup</strong> shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li><strong>1</strong> egg, lightly beaten</li>
			<li><strong>1 pinch</strong> ground nutmeg</li>
			<li><strong>1 pinch</strong> dried basil</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li><strong>1 cup</strong> pasta sauce</li>
			<li><strong>½ cup</strong> shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li><strong>¼ cup</strong> grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 1 1/2-quart
				casserole dish with cooking spray.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the
				boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to
				the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below
				the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add spinach, cover,
				and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Drain spinach.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mix spinach, ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, egg, nutmeg,
				basil, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spread 1/4 cup pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish;
				top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/4 cup
				pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, 1/2 cup ricotta mixture,
				and 1/4 cup pasta sauce. End with remaining 3 lasagna noodles and 1/4
				cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese
				on top. Cover casserole with aluminum foil.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover casserole and
				continue baking until lasagna is bubbling and lightly browned, about 25
				more minutes. Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.
			</li>
