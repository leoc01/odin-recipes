		<h1>Mushroom Gravy</h1>
		<img src="../images/mushroom-gravy.webp" alt="an amazing mushroom gravy" />
		<p>This gravy is sure to please any vegetarian or even non-vegetarian.</p>
		<p>
			It's flavorful, rich, and is as good on turkey or prime rib as it is on a
			vegetarian meatloaf or mashed potatoes.
		</p>
		<p>
			It can be made in advance, stored in the fridge, and reheated on the
			stovetop or in the microwave.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>5 tablespoons</strong> unsalted butter, divided</li>
			<li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> shallot, minced</li>
			<li><strong>12 ounces</strong> baby bella mushrooms, sliced</li>
			<li><strong>2</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li><strong>½ teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
			<li><strong>½ teaspoon</strong> ground black pepper</li>
			<li><strong>⅓ cup</strong> sherry</li>
			<li><strong>¼ cup</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
			<li><strong>3 cups</strong> vegetable broth (such as Kitchen Basics®)</li>
			<li><strong>1 ½ teaspoons</strong> dried tarragon</li>
			<li><strong>3 teaspoons</strong> low-sodium soy sauce</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
				shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are a deep
				golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in mushrooms, garlic, salt, and
				pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are nicely browned,
				3 to 5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pour sherry into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned
				bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and
				stir until sherry is reduced, about 2 minutes. Remove mushroom mixture
				from the skillet and set aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reduce heat to medium-low and melt remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in
				the skillet. Add flour to make a roux, stirring continuously, until
				mixture is light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Add vegetable broth and
				tarragon; whisk until gravy is smooth and no lumps of flour remain.
			</li>
			<li>
				Increase heat to medium-high, return mushroom mixture to the skillet,
				and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until
				mixture has reduced, about 8 minutes. Stir in soy sauce. Adjust
				seasonings, if necessary.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Cook's Note</h2>
		<p>
			If reheating, add a bit more broth to thin out the gravy if necessary.
